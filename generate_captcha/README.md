## CAPTCHA generator. Just for fun :).

The CAPTCHA created like this:

Actually this is used to generate training data of project [CNN_keras](https://github.com/skyduy/CNN_keras)

### example:
```python
from captcha.core import Captcha

c = Captcha(150, 40, debug=True)
c.batch_create_img(10)
```

#### TODO
 - improve performance.
 - support multi parameters.
